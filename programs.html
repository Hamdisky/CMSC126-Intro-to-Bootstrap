PROGRAM PROFILE

The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology degree program with two major fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology. Areas of study in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division has recently been expanded to include not only studies of life forms at cellular level, but also molecular studies of plant, animal and microbial life forms.

The BS Biology curriculum also includes the conduct of an undergraduate thesis which provides the students the opportunity to perform research work along their chosen field of specialization under the guidance of their selected faculty adviser.

JOB OPPORTUNITIES

Students may proceed to pursue a medical degree after graduation. Other graduates may pursue careers in either government and private institutions as teachers or researchers, or in government organizations engaged in biological conservation and/or advocacy activities.

              <p>
              <pre>
Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years back. Managerial problems, especially those faced by decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have become less structured than they were in the past.  Increasingly, managers have to deal with more sophisticated technologies, more rapidly expanding and contracting markets.  In adapting to these changes, organizations have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more integrative in approach to decision-making, and more global in operation.

Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes imperative for organizational leaders to develop the capability to assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.

Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the carriers of today’s most important resources (knowledge and information), and holistic because managerial problems and issues are interrelated.

The program aims to hone the following managerial skills and competences:
* Human skills – ability to lead and motivate
* Analytical skills – ability to discern relationships, detect dysfunction, identity and evaluate options
* Integrative skills– ability to perceive the whole picture and latticework of interdependencies

* Innovativeness – ability to develop approaches in applying new and continually evolving stock of knowledge and information
* Proactiveness – the ability to anticipate problems and issues to set the tone for change and develop orientation or concern for the enhancement of the human condition in the long run

ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS

1. A bachelor’s degree in any field of study
2. A minimum of 2.5 or equivalent average grade
3. At least 2 years of managerial or supervisory experience
